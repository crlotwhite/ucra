# JSON Library Evaluation Report

**Date:** 2024-08-13
**Task:** Subtask 2.2 - Evaluate and Select a C/C++ JSON Library
**Project:** UCRA SDK

## Requirements Analysis

For the UCRA manifest parser implementation, we need a JSON library that meets the following criteria:

1. **C99 Compatibility**: Must work with C99 standard for maximum portability
2. **Performance**: Efficient parsing for manifest files (typically small to medium size)
3. **Low Dependency Footprint**: Minimal external dependencies
4. **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing CMake build system
5. **Reliability**: Well-tested and actively maintained

## Evaluated Libraries

### 1. RapidJSON
- **Language**: C++ (C++11+)
- **Type**: Header-only library
- **Performance**: Excellent (designed for speed)
- **Integration**: Good CMake support
- **Pros**: Very fast, well-documented, active development
- **Cons**: C++ only, not compatible with C99 requirement
- **Verdict**: ❌ Disqualified due to C++ requirement

### 2. JsonCpp
- **Language**: C++ (C++11+)
- **Type**: Traditional library with .cpp/.h files
- **Performance**: Good (moderate speed)
- **Integration**: Excellent CMake support
- **Pros**: Easy to use, good documentation, stable API
- **Cons**: C++ only, heavier than needed for our use case
- **Verdict**: ❌ Disqualified due to C++ requirement

### 3. cJSON
- **Language**: Pure C (C89/C99 compatible)
- **Type**: Single header + source file
- **Performance**: Good (sufficient for manifest parsing)
- **Integration**: Easy (minimal files to include)
- **Pros**:
  - C99 compatible ✅
  - Minimal dependency footprint (2 files)
  - Active development on GitHub
  - Well-tested in production
  - Simple API
  - MIT licensed
- **Cons**: Less feature-rich than C++ alternatives
- **Verdict**: ✅ Selected

## Final Decision: cJSON

**Rationale:**
- Meets the critical C99 compatibility requirement
- Minimal integration complexity (just 2 files)
- Sufficient performance for manifest file parsing
- Active maintenance and community support
- Simple, clean API suitable for our use case

## Integration Plan

1. **Download cJSON**: Add cJSON.c and cJSON.h to the project
2. **CMake Integration**: Add cJSON compilation to CMakeLists.txt
3. **API Wrapper**: Create UCRA-specific wrapper functions
4. **Testing**: Implement parsing tests with sample manifests

## Proof of Concept

A proof of concept will be implemented to demonstrate:
- Parsing a sample resampler.json file
- Error handling for malformed JSON
- Memory management
- Integration with existing build system

## Performance Characteristics

Based on research and benchmarks:
- cJSON parsing speed: Moderate (suitable for manifest files < 1MB)
- Memory usage: Low overhead
- Compile time: Fast (single source file)
- Binary size impact: Minimal

## Conclusion

cJSON is the optimal choice for the UCRA manifest parser, balancing all requirements while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
